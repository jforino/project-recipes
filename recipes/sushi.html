    <p>Sushi is definitely one of my all time favorite foods. Though it can 
        be a bit time consuming to make. It is totally worth it and can be 
        really fun to make at parties. I have outlined an easy recipe for a 
        California Roll below.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked Sushi Rice</li>
        <li>Rice Vinegar</li>
        <li>Imitation Crab</li>
        <li>Sushi Grade Nori (Seaweed)</li>
        <li>1 Avocado</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Sesame Seeds <em>(optional) though it does increase the flavor dramatically.</em></li>
        <li>Rolling Mat for Sushi</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your cooked sushi rice and toss with some rice vinegar and
            a little bit of sugar. 
        </li>
        <li>Cut your cucumber into tiny slits.</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of nori on a rolling mat</li>
        <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of sushi rice, and place evenly
            on the sheet of nori.
        </li>
        <li>Add in imitation crab, sliced cucumbers, and avocado.</li>
        <li>Roll the nori sheet using the rolling mat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle sesame seeds along the outside of the sushi roll.</li>
        <p><em>It is important to note that in order to mitigate rice sticking
            to your fingers, its best to have a bowl of water to dip your hands in once
            they start feeling sticky.
        </em></p>
    </ol>

    <p>That's about it! Enjoy your sushi!</p>
